# Our One

Do you see that wandering soul?

Do you think we should deceive it?

No, let us simply open and make ourselves be seen.

Why must we always argue about this?

Together, It only seems natural to me.

I'll greet it with such a smile that can only be sympathized with.

But I'll condescend, seek its affection.

With great skill forming a connection.

Why must you shield ourself from them and show but our masque.

Together, I wish you would never show yourself.

Even when far away you hail souls with such fiction and to their waves reply in such irrational ways
