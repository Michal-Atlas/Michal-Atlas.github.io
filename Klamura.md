General
=======

-   Klamuran works on a stack principal
-   Every sentence builds up a sort of object that is interpreted at the
    end
-   Every word takes N objects from the stack and applies some sort of
    transformation to them
-   Some words are shared between a Noun and Verb form, this doesn\'t
    brake determinism since, verbs are always the last symbol in a
    sentence thus followed by a sentence separator
-   An apostrophe after a character does one of two things based on
    it\'s type
    -   Vowel: The sound is slightly elongated
    -   Consonant: The sound is repeated with an inserted glotal stop

represented sounds.

Pronouns
========

Pronoun words are like variables, a user may save an object to it to
then later recall it without having to specify it in its entirety.

The word `Tzo` takes two arguments, returning the first, but assigning a
reference to it to the second.

``` {.example}
Ranios Nezetzios Ka Tzo Xaze. (The Revered Creature was killed. + Assigned "Revered Creature" to Ka.)
Keos Ka Xaze. (I killed 'it'.)
```
