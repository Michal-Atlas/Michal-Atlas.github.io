Welp, finally figured out why the GitHub site didn't work,
the theme broke it for some reason.
Minima is simple, simplicity is life.

Anyways, imma put some thoughts here,
imma try to do it bi-daily or something,
but it wouldn't make sense to publish when there's nothing to say.

Imma work on DawnStorm mainly now,
want to give it some polish.

Sometime tommorow the new domain will activate,
and I'll have to migrate all the projects.
If someone asks, I did only buy Columbia because it's cheapest.

There's just a lot of things happening in the world right now,
none of which are happening here,
that doesn't mean we don't have our own problems.
I hope this will take the mind of some things.
If some people can do what they do in spite of a health crisis,
imma at least try to stay productive and positive.
