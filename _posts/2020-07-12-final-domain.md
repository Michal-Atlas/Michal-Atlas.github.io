So, three (at least 2) Indians later,
I managed to get the domain registered.
From what they said, it seems that indeed
the 9 digit phone number was the problem.
But hey, domain is here and even under 72 hours,
which is how long many other sites will take by default.

So... noice.

There's so many domains,
and many can point to multiple servers.
Makes you marvel at the size of the web,
people have created.
