title: Domain Shenanigans
---

Hm, strange, I expected the domain to be setup by now.
Though it makes sense for it to take longer since `.tk` was first party and here they have to send it to other places.

So, I messaged support after about 25 hours,
since they claim 24 hours.
I wouldn't be so impatient normally,
however it was still up for sale,
so I figured something must've gone wrong.
First, they looked at my phone number,
which I know I entered incorrectly, but fixed ASAP (or so I thought).
Then they said that it's **Interesting**, which I'd definitely say
if I encountered an undocumented problem.
It'll have to be escalated to a "Specialist", let's see.
Funny that the IP location in the support mails is India.

Still nothing,
I figured it could be because of EDT having night right now,
but apparently it's 2 in the afternoon.
I'm just hyped slightly,
and mainly I'm curious what the issue is,
I hope they'll tell me.

Been experimenting with the old `.tk` domain some more,
linking it to the new provider.
Having you own mail domain is so cool,
not that useful probably,
at least it looks interesting.

I found out about a DNS provider that doesn't answer
requests for adverts or NSFW stuff,
that's very smart, although I wouldn't trust a teen not to find workarounds.
Also, there's a project organising free HTTPS keys,
hooray for security I guess.

Last thing, the site I used for my domain registration doesn't support 9 digit phone numbers.
I mean, what the hell, they might be based in a 10 digit country but c'mon.
It prepends a 0 to make it 10 digits, which they say is fine,
but I think it might cause problems sooner or later.

I hope I'm not causing too much trouble over a `2$` domain.
Oh well, the problems are mostly on their part anyways,
but I must say they've been as helpful as they could.
