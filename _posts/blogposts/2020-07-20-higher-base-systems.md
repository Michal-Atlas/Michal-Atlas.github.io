I don't get why we underutilize higher bases within our numbers.
For a time now, I've been wondering where using base 36
(numbers 0-9 and Letters of the English Alphabet)
could provide either savings or ease of use.
I do understand that for instance phone numbers,
cannot use letters due to old landline phones,
and many systems would have problems with compatibility.

However, it would be a great input method.
The savings aren't about size,
because digital records take up the space anyway.
But people are much better at
remembering a set of symbols if it is shorter,
rather than if it has less symbols.

If you have a keyboard handy,
rather than a numpad, Base 36 is quite superior.

There is one issue, and that is the difference between 0 and O.
Often, zero is written with a dot in the middle, which helps,
but other times there is no difference at all.
I sometimes use &Theta; (Greek Theta) to differentiate,
but it is not at all ideal, since zero is the one with the dot in many fonts.
