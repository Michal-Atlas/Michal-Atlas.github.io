Let's talk a bit about psychology,
many of you might've heard about Synesthesia,
it's when someone has two senses somewhat connected/mixed.

There are many many forms and one significantly more niche one that I have is called Ordinal Linguistic Personification.

People with OLP assign gender and personality to many different things,
mostly though sets of arbitrary symbols, like months, days, numbers and letters.
My case excludes personality and stays perfectly static as long as I've been aware of it. This is something that we simply feel inside
is the right thing to assign,
and since they're inanimate objects I'm fine with assuming someone's gender for once.

You might think that this could be a quirk of gendered languages,
one of which is my native tongue,
however Czech assigns blanket genders to all of these.
All numbers are female, and the rest are neuter (yes, we have 3 genders).

My personification applies for a number of patterns, that I will now list:

## Numbers

|Num|Gender|
|:---:|---|
|1|Female|
|2|Female|
|3|Male|
|4|Female|
|5|Female|
|6|Male|
|7|Female|
|8|Male|
|9|Male|

> Higher up numbers are just combinations of these digits
