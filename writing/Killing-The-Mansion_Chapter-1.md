# Killing The Mansion: Chapter 1 - The High Life

An old white crow roosts upon the great old clock as the chime of Big Ben fills the streets of London.
This ancient sound echoes through the busy streets the wind carrying it all the way, to a manor of one Clerval Angell.
This brisk young man was just enjoying breakfast sitting in his armchair looking through the windows of his study.
The weather had been particularly sunny that day but cold as ever as this still was England.
Once finished with his french bread he donned a black coat, took hold of his purple cane and headed out the front door where a carriage had already been waiting for him.
He took it to the club where he spent his days idly indulging in small talk waiting for those few acquaintances whom he came to grow fond of.
With a strong swing, the club's door swings open as Clerval enters.
He scans the room and almost immediately darts to a table of two.
The reasons he came here were Lucian C.
Gosling and his father, both of whom he knew mainly for attending and organising various events.
Lucian preferred the presence of wiser men however, he had a soft spot for this here friend and tolerated his presence.
They spoke of new affairs, new people and then got stuck on scientific breakthroughs for a while.
Clerval knew little of these subjects, for he didn't read preferring daydreaming and walks to fill most of his days, but he was a good listener and Lucian's father loved him for it.
At the end of this long conversation, as they were giving their farewells, Lucian's father invited Clerval to a masquerade they were having this evening at their house.
Clerval was very happy to hear this and rushed off to fetch himself a costume.

The masquerade was huge, the whole manor was filled with people.
The music was the finest of the time, performed by the most outstanding musicians.
Sometime while in the manor, while Clerval is marvelling at the beauty of some family portraits of the Gosling's, Clerval had noticed with the corner of his eye a fair lady in a purple dress, with long flowing hair and a mask containing a single eye motif.
She approaches Clerval with a steady, calculated walk, almost reminiscent that of a clock and lowers herself into a deep courtesy.
Clerval returns the greeting, however as he is about to say something, the woman interrupts him.
She simply asks him whether or not he wants to attend an event to honour a birthday in her household.
Clerval is somewhat perplexed by this for it was not only said in a deeply strange way but also came sort of out of nowhere and so left him slightly stunned.
But always a sucker for some interesting entertainment he gently nodded.
As soon as the lady saw the slightest movement of approval she smiled, turned around and started walking away.
When Clerval came to his senses, the woman had already made it almost to the end of the hallway.
Clerval took a step forward and shouted out to stop her, but to no avail.
So he tried following her, first with a quick walk, then he broke into a run, attracting the attention of many bystanders.
The woman took a corner just as Clerval was about to catch up to here, already stretching out his hand.
But after turning the corner himself he found her already at the end of the next hallway, at this point Clerval stopped, gave out his last shout after which he gave up for he saw there was no way he could catch up with her.
He simply stood there, he doesn't know how long, nor does he care.
The only thing he can now think about is what he just witnessed.
He spent the rest of the evening slowly shambling around asking every single person he met about the woman.
Once the masquerade had ended Lucian pulled Clerval aside and asked him about being visited by a strange woman.
At that moment Clerval's eyes light up and he almost maniacally grabs his friend and starts shaking him for answers.
Lucian relays the exact same events as what Clerval had seen with the slight difference that he declined the offer.
He notes however that when he declined the offer the woman smiled widely and ...
Lucian stops his story, an empty expression entering his face.
Lucian tells Clerval to go home and get some sleep, before breaking free of his grip and disappearing into the crowd.
Clerval arrives at home quite down and quickly dozes off to sleep.
Clerval is suddenly awakened by a loud sound coming from across his bedroom.
He opens his eyes and slowly identifies the source of the sounds as someone behind his bedroom door.
He slowly sits up and after thoroughly getting his thoughts in order, he begrudgingly lifted himself off of his bed.
Grabbing his nightgown and trusty cane which he held with both hands for the occasion in which he'd have to defend himself, he slowly made his way to the door.
At this point, he noticed the windows were surprisingly dark that day, no stars, no moon, nothing.
Clerval raises one hand holding his cane tightly, the other outstretching to the door's handle.
As he is about to open the door, however, the door opens itself and Clerval saw a woman standing right in front of him, her stance revealing she knew he would be there when she opened.
Clerval wanted to scream but contained himself because he recognized the woman for she had over one eye a patch held by 3 black silk straps with the same motif as that on the mask of the woman he had met earlier that night.
In the same unsettling tone, as she always spoke, she introduced herself as Elizabeth of the Jadewill mansion, and with a step to the side, she said that after enjoying his meal she will be waiting for him outside.
He took a few steps forward and saw his dining table empty, so he walked across the room to the bell he uses to ring his kitchen.
The bell fell silent but when Clerval turned around he found the dining table filled with exotic, rich foods some of which he had never seen.
He had his meal, dressed up in the best he had and toilets himself.
He hears St.
Stephen's tower strike three and says to himself that he is ready to leave.
He rests his hand upon the front door, and with a great deep breath he pushes the door open.

The door leaves Clerval's hand as soon as he gives it the slightest touch, the door swings open and moves towards him, disappearing behind him.
He had entered a nice little room, red curtains in the corners, revealing the 4 walls to be covered using green wallpaper and golden decorative paint.
In the middle there stood an armchair and a small table with a glass of wine and a newspaper.
Clerval notes no doors being in this room but assumes nothing of it for old castles always had secret doors, often even used for theatricality as the host moved around the mansion.
He sits in the armchair, opens the newspaper and starts reading, the most interesting fact about the newspaper being that it was dated today, but he already knew it was three in the morning, this bugged him, but not for long.
He is very quickly interrupted by a drop of something red that fell upon his paper from above.
He looks up and sees the room mirrored.
At first, he thought it was a huge mirror, but he saw Lucian in the middle instead of him.
Lucian was holding the glass of wine and had spilt some of it.
He waves at Clerval and apologies for nearly ruining his suit.
Clerval calls it no matter and rather admires the ingenuity required for this magnificent illusion.
Clerval then asks Lucian why he lied to him when he said he wouldn't come, Lucian simply says he wanted to surprise him and that he is now sorry after he saw how he reacted.
Nonetheless, Elise comes in through a door Clerval had not yet noticed and after the customary apologies for making them wait, told him that everything was now ready and that they would now meet the event organizer.
Clerval snuck a peek up at Lucian and saw that he was seemingly reacting in the same way but as Elise was nowhere to be found he seemingly nodded toward air.
The four corners started to shine with bright light and the curtains started to twist, the walls sprouted fur and outstretched into a beautiful carpet.
A choir of what sounded like hundreds was starting to be heard.
The curtains now covered both walls, going higher and higher and as they dropped, Clerval and Lucian are revealed to be standing in an enormous cathedral.

A slender icy blue light now illuminating the entire nave, shining through tall red and black stained glass windows.
Which depicted various gothic scenes and complimented the stunning architecture, filled to the brim with statues.
At the far end of this great scene, a rose window guided light down below unto a tall figure dressed in a long red cloak surrounded by a choir of many blue cloaked singers.
The figure was bowing and beckoned them to approach.
Welcome to Jadewill Mansion he said, I am Astrophel.
Thank you for agreeing to come to our humble place of dwelling.
