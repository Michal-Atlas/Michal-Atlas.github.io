I tend to suffer from nightmares,
the last one was very gruesome.
I was a black man, for some reason,
seemed a bit like those that you would find in zombie fiction,
and that would make sense, since there were a lot of zombies.

Strangely enough, none of them attacked me.
Instead, i drove from tragedy to tragedy in an old rusty yellow bus.
There was one that kept reappearing.
"My daughter" (I don't have one), was trapped in a glass cage.
The glass was the type you'd see in gyms, with the metal grid woven into it.
And a man stood beside this scene, and explained to me.

Your daughter isn't pleased that you have all your limbs.
Your daughter isn't pleased that you still have your head.
Your daughter isn't pleased that you still have both your eyes.

And like you may have in a video-game, she ran against the glass cage,
her feet just sliding on the ground, she paid no notice to anything around her.
